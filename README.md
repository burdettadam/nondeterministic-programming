# Nondeterministic Programming

This project explores the idea a program could nondeterministic replicate
itself iteratively towards an ambiguous goal.

## Causal Loops

“So there’s this man, he has a time machine. Another thing he has is a
passion for the works of Ludwig van Beethoven. And one day he thinks,
“What’s the point of having a time machine if you don’t get to meet your heroes.”
So. Off he goes to 18-century Germany. But he can’t find Beethoven anywhere.
No one’s heard of him. Not even his family have any idea who the time traveller
is talking about. Beethoven literally doesn’t exist. This is called the bootstrap paradox.
The time traveller panics. He can’t bear the thought of a world without the music of
Beethoven. Luckily, he’d brought all of his Beethoven sheet music for Ludwig to sign.
So he copies out all the concertos and the symphonies and he gets them published.
He becomes Beethoven. And history continues with barely a feather ruffled. My question is this:
who put those notes and phrases together? Who really composed Beethoven’s Fifth?”" - The Doctor

## An observers Response of the bootstrap

Suppose Ludwig van Beethoven never did exist, but the culture of the 18-century was very
interesting to this man with a time machine. You see he found historic notes of that era
and was compelled to visit. During his travels he made friends, learned traits and changed
the original historic notes that attracted him in the first place to enhance his travel.
The changes in these notes in turn changed his own history he had no memory of. The very
history of this mans travels produced notes that initiated his trip. Watching this circular
dependent history play out, the man changes historic notes to attract himself to music,
he starts publishing his notes in names that attract him and assist his travels. Each change
of history causes him to edit those notes until finally, this man no longer see’s himself in
Ludwig Van Beethoven so he preserves Beethoven legacy by creating him and his publications.
The man fears the loss of Beethoven and does not change the notes that lead him there. Watching
the bootstrap of Beethoven’s Fifth leads one to think that history itself was the true composer.
