# Central Dogma of Genetic Evolution

Evolution is the competition of genetic instruction to replicate driven by the cost of resources to exist.
For evolution to occur there must be a genetic instruction which self replicates with variation for a cost
which creates competition to replicate. The competition between genetic variation favors certain change which
results in optimization of the genetic instruction and competition. Genetic instruction describes and follows
a biochemical process that enables replication with variance. An emergent property of genetic instruction is
unencoded instruction which is only expressed in extreme competition. This unencoded genetic instruction gives
extra aid in competing, which is passed on during replication. Genetic instruction highly optimized to current
competition will have random variation which will encode previous unencoded genetic instruction that provides
new adapted genetic instruction which allows new competition between the genetic instruction and cost to replicate.
The new genetic instruction allows further optimizations of environment reactions. This natural emergent property
of self encoding genetic systems allows unbounded evolution. During time of stable environment, genetic systems
create competition with in the environment by consuming resources that optimize encoded and un-encoded base
instruction allowing new genetic instruction to emerge.

(The environment determines the encoded base instruction is persisted with additional filtering of un-encoded
instructions.)

Genetic instruction is the base structures for genetic systems that make up populations. Each population is a
system adapted to a specific environment reactions. All populations have common genetic instructions which allows
another emergent property, cross population instruction donation. Genetic instruction optimized in populations
with different environment competition will cross population, adding more optimized genetic instruction that would
not be possible in a single population.

## Environment

Environments provides competition with limited resources. As genetic instruction replicates, populations will
become codependent. One population will create resources for the other population and vise verses. This becomes a
self regulating environment competition. Evolution does not stop, unencoded genetic instruction is optimized until
a new resources is consumable or produced. If the self regulating environment is isolated and the genetic instruction
has optimized anti-evolution instructions, then evolution will be paused until variance in instruction or resource is
changed, but genetic instruction is always subject to being evolved.

## Characteristics of evolving genetic systems

- base instruction is inert, stable and self persisting (DNA structure)
- base instruction encodes to chemicals which build molecules that compose blocks of a individual in a population. (DNA->RNA->Protein->cell->organism->population->distributed system)
- base instruction defines chemistry which replicates itself (Replication, by nature of no longer existing other wise)
- base instruction is defined by environment variables(what instruction is allowed to persist)
- base instruction increases competition in an environment
- base instruction contains un-encoding instruction that is encoded during unusual environment changes(emergent property that allows unbounded evolution)
- base instruction structure has a limit that restricts encoded and un-encoded instructions
- base instruction is transferred from separate populations that do not participate in replication(cross species virus)

 Environments remove base instructions by:

- random removing (specimen death, random deletions)
- low fitness test (expressed DNA fit test)
- low environmental change test (un-expressed DNA fit test)
- cross species pollination failure

## emergent properties of evolving genetic systems

- emotion is the reaction of genetic instruction to new environment change
- De novo genes from un expressed instruction
- cross population instruction pollination (virus)
- replication variance
